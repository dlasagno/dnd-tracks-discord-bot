# dnd-tracks-discord-bot
A discord bot to play D&D tracks while playing

## Installation
Clone the repository on your server/computer and run npm start to start using the bot.
The tracks are taken from tracks.json: for every category of tracks you can specify an array of youtube urls that will be played by the bot.
Note that the bot token should be specified in a .env file in an environment variable called DISCORD_TOKEN.
